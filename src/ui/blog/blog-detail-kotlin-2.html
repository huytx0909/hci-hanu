          <h2>Keeping track of coroutines</h2>
          <br> <br>
          <p>In part one, we explored the problems that coroutines are great at solving. As a recap, coroutines are a
            great solution to two common programming problems:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Long running tasks</b> are tasks that take too long to block the main thread.</li>
            <li><b>Main-safety</b> allows you to ensure that any suspend function can be called from the main thread.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>To solve these problems, coroutines build upon regular functions by adding <b>suspend</b> and
            <b>resume</b>. When all
            coroutines on a particular thread are suspended, the thread is free to do other work.</p>
          <p>However, coroutines by themselves don’t help you keep track of the work that’s being done. It’s perfectly
            fine to have a large number of coroutines — hundreds or even thousands — and have all of them suspended at
            the same time. And, while coroutines are cheap, the work they perform is often expensive, like reading files
            or making network requests.</p>
          <p>It’s quite difficult to keep track of one thousand coroutines manually using code. You could try to track
            all of them and manually ensure they complete or cancel, but code like this is tedious and error prone. If
            the code is not perfect, it will lose track of a coroutine, which is what I call a work leak.</p>
          <p>A work leak is like a memory leak, but worse. It’s a coroutine that’s been lost. In addition to using
            memory, a work leak can resume itself to use CPU, disk, or even launch a network request.</p>
          <p>To help avoid leaking coroutines, Kotlin introduced structured concurrency. Structured concurrency is a
            combination of language features and best practices that, when followed, help you keep track of all work
            running in coroutines.</p>
          <p>On Android, we can use structured concurrency to do three things:
          </p>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Cancel work</b> when it is no longer needed.</li>
            <li><b>Keep track</b> of work while it’s running.</li>
            <li><b>Signal errors</b> when a coroutine fails.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>Lets dive into each of these and see how structured concurrency helps us make sure we never lose track of a
            coroutine and leak work..</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Cancel work with scopes</h2>
          <br> <br>
          <p>In Kotlin, coroutines must run in something called a CoroutineScope. A <code>CoroutineScope</code> keeps
            track of your
            coroutines, even coroutines that are suspended. Unlike the Dispatchers we talked about in part one, it
            doesn’t actually execute your coroutines — it just makes sure you don’t lose track of them.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>To ensure that all coroutines are tracked, Kotlin does not allow you to start a new coroutine without a
            CoroutineScope. You can think of a CoroutineScope as sort of like lightweight version of an ExecutorService
            with superpowers. It grants you the ability to start new coroutines which come with all that suspend and
            resume goodness we explored in part one.</p>
          <p>A CoroutineScope keeps track of all your coroutines, and it can cancel all of the coroutines started in it.
            This fits well with Android development where you want to ensure that you clean up everything that was
            started by a screen when the user leaves.</p>
          <blockquote class="quote-card blue-card">
            <p>
              A CoroutineScope keeps track of all your coroutines, and it can cancel all of the coroutines started in
              it.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <br>
          <h2>Starting new coroutines</h2>
          <br> <br>
          <p>
            It’s important to note that you can’t just call a suspend function from anywhere. The suspend and resume
            mechanism requires that you switch from normal functions to a coroutine.
          </p>
          <p>There are two ways to start coroutines, and they have different uses:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>launch</b> builder will start a new coroutine that is “fire and forget” — that means it won’t return
              the result to the caller.</li>
            <li><b>async</b> builder will start a new coroutine, and it allows you to return a result with a suspend
              function called <code>await</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>In almost all cases, the right answer for how to start a coroutine from a regular function is to use
            launch. Since the regular function has no way to call await (remember, it can’t call suspend functions
            directly) it doesn’t make much sense to use async as your main entry to coroutines. We’ll talk later about
            when it makes sense to use async.</p>
          <p>We will discuss more in the next part</p>
